## Missing Data

### Approaches
- The most basic approach is to just delete the observations (rows). This is default for most software, but could possibly reduce sample size.


### Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)
+ Data is removed with consistent with data and are missing at random.
+ Reasonable with justifications for deleting missing rows
+ Deleting Rows could affect popu;ation definition.


### Missing at Random (MAR)
+ Observations


### Missing Not at Random (MNAR)
+ There is some systematic reason why your data is deleted. Example previous colon cancer


### Imputation
+ Insert missing values with mean or median. 
+ If it is a categorical variable, replace the missing values with the most common categorical level.
